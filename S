### **Technical Impact**  
All resources in the HSB19191 GCP project will be deleted, resulting in the unavailability of the application. Data loss is not critical as the application is no longer needed, with logs already collected from instances and SQL data being exported. The deletion will reduce operational costs significantly.

---

### **Backout Plan**  
If export or log collection fails, retry the process, as data loss won't affect the environment. In case of errors during resource deletion, pause the process, validate resources, and recreate critical components if needed. If project deletion fails, resolve any dependencies and retry.
