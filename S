Hi Rakesh Chowdhary,  

Could you kindly assist me with a few things?  

I am currently using AWS CLI on Windows for uploading, as per the details in the following confluence document:  
[Using 53-API with AWS CLI on Windows](https://alm-confluence.systems.uk.hsbc/confluence/display/CSE/Using+53-api+with+AWS+cli+on+windows).  

Below is the version information of AWS CLI installed on my system:  
```  
Z:\>aws --version  
aws-cli/2.2.10 Python/3.8.8 Windows/10 exe/AMD64 prompt/off  
```  

I have received the secret access key from Richard Winton. However, I noticed a "35%" ID, and I observed that it matches the bucket name. Could you please confirm if this is correct?  

Additionally, could you help me with the appropriate endpoint URL for the configuration?  

Thank you for your support.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
