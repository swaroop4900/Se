### **Post-Implementation Verification**  
Verify that all Cloud SQL data has been successfully exported and stored. Ensure Kubernetes logs are fully collected and saved. Confirm that all resources, including instances, images, and storage, have been deleted as per the plan. Finally, validate that the project deletion is completed and no cost-incurring resources remain in the project.
