### **Implementation Plan**

**Objective:**  
Decommission the HSB19191 GCP project, supporting an unused application, by backing up essential data, deleting resources, and preparing for project deletion.

---

### **Steps for Implementation:**

1. **Backup and Data Export**  
   - Export Cloud SQL data to Cloud Storage.  
   - Download the SQL export locally for safekeeping.  
   - Collect logs from Kubernetes pods and store them securely.

2. **Resource Deletion**  
   - Delete all Compute Engine instances, Cloud SQL instances, and Cloud Storage buckets.  
   - Remove all images, firewall rules, load balancers, and external IP addresses, following GCP policies.

3. **Final Cleanup**  
   - Verify that all cost-incurring resources have been removed.  
   - Ensure no residual elements remain in the project.

4. **Project Deletion**  
   - Complete the prerequisites and delete the GCP project.  

This ensures proper decommissioning, cost optimization, and adherence to GCP standards.
