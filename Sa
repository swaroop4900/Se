**Subject:** Request for Guidance on Log Storage and Next Steps  

Dear [Recipient's Name],  

I hope this email finds you well.  

As part of the ongoing efforts to retire our [environment name], I have collected all the required logs, which are currently stored on my PC. However, as per the requirements, these logs need to be moved to a designated storage location.  

I also understand from our discussions with Nirav that we need to coordinate with the networking team to proceed further. Unfortunately, I do not have any source of contact for the networking team, and I need your help to connect with the appropriate person or team.  

Key points for your input:  
1. Should I proceed with the current logs stored on my PC and move ahead with the demise process?  
2. Alternatively, should I wait until the logs are uploaded to the storage location as discussed?  

Additionally, as part of this transition, we need to:  
- Collect Cloud SQL backups and download them.  
- Implement these backups during the CR window.  
- Collect logs from Kubernetes pods during the CR window.  

Your timely input and assistance in connecting with the networking team will help us move forward effectively.  

Looking forward to your guidance.  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
